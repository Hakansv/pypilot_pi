pypilot Plugin for OpenCPN
=======================================
OpenCPN can communicate with pypilot already via nmea to receive compass
heading, and to autopilot, and the plugin is not strictly required.

The plugin allows for configuration and tuning of the autopilot in ways
not possible through basic nmea0183 messaging.  The plugin also allows
for graphical overlays of the autopilot settings directly onto the chart.

Compiling
=========

* git clone git://github.com/seandepagnier/pypilot_pi.git

Do NOT attempt to build this plugin from within the OpenCPN source tree.

Under windows, you must find the file "opencpn.lib" (Visual Studio) or "libopencpn.dll.a" (mingw) which is built in the build directory after compiling opencpn.  This file must be copied to the plugin directory.

Build as normally:

* cd ..
* cd build
* cmake ..
* make
* make install
